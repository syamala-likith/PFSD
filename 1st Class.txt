Fetaures Of Python:
		*Easy to understand and learn.
		*Python is called as an Interpretend Language.
		*Object oriented language where u will use all the moocs concepts nessesaries.
		*Open source Language.
		*Supports wide range of libraries and frame works.
		*GUI acts as a medium b/w the user and server.

Various Areas Here Python Is Used:
		*AI and Data Science, Data Mining, Meachine Learning, Software Development,
		 Mobile Applications, 3D Apllications, Speach Recognisation, Image Prossecing Apllications and (**Web Applications**).

Python Basic Syntax:
		*Indentations is to defined block of a code and it is nothing but (**White Spaces**).

Applications Of Python:
		*You Tube, Netflix, Face_Book, Instagram, LinkedIn, Quora and Drop_Box.

Populor Frame Works In Python:
		*Web Development(Server Side:-"ADMINS are Server Side"):- Dango, Flask, Pyramid, Cherrypy.
		*GUI based applications:- TK, PYGTR, PYQL, PYJS.
		*Meachine Learning:- Tensorflow, pytorch, Matplotlib, Mathematics(numpy or pandas).

Limitations In Python:
		*Not Good for Gaming.
		*More Libraries.
		*No dedicated supports for the libraries and the libraries are in huge.

Comment Lines In Python:
		1.# :- used for single line command.
		2."text" :- Multi line comment or documnets frame.

Python Data Structures:
		1.Primitive:
			*integer, float, String and boolean.
		2.Non Primitive:
			*It is catogarised into built in and user defined.
			1.Built In:
					List, Tuple, Dictionary, Set.
			2.User Defined:
					   Stack, Queue, Linked List and Tree.

List In Python:
		*Python list holds the ordered Collection of Items that indicates the Sequance.
		*List is mutable(modifications can be done).
		*The Items od the list are enclosed with in the square brackets([]) sapareted by coma(,).
		*Example: 
				 a=[1,"Likith",12.5,true]
				 print(len(a))
				 print(a)

Tuple In Python:
		*It is used to store sequance of immutable python objects.
		*The Items od the list are enclosed with in the square brackets(()) sapareted by coma(,).
		*The Tuples are immutable(Modifications can't be done).
		*Example: 
				 a=(1,"Likith",12.5,true)
				 print(len(a))
				 print(a)
